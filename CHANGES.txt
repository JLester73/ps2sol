Added code to properly handle the year-long writing administrations.
Also now converts school #8000 to #8888 to match what Pearson
expects for the Out-Of-District school.

Added a "clobber" task to Rakefile that will clear out all
CSV files.  Changed headers.csv to headers.inp so it won't
get deleted when you run the clobber task.

Due to the odd schedule for 2020-2021, I had to add some
important changes to both the Rakefile and ps2sol.  In
our case, we have some students in-person and some students
fully virtual.  We track that in PowerSchool using the Track
field in the Students table.  For us, A means A-Day
(Monday, Tuesday), B means B-Day (Thursday, Friday),
C means fully in-person, and D means fully virtual.

If you pass the parameter --track to ps2sol, you need
to include a p (in-person) or v (virtual) as well.

Example, pull only virtual students from school 40, the
command might look like this:

  ./ps2sol --school 40 --in 40.csv --type course --admin nwsprg21 --track v
  
In the Rakefile, a line was added for TRACK in case
you want to run all schools for virtual or all for
in-person.  To run all in-person, set that line like:

  TRACK = '--track p'
  
To run all virtual:

  TRACK = '--track v'
  
To run all students:

  TRACK = ''
