Very minor update, added blank field for PNP Web Extension

Note that PNP Calculator and PNP Web Extension will need to be
set manually before upload if needed.

Also, there are new test codes for the quad 8 schools (8888).

Finally, we've found it is best to pull the output into Excel
to make needed changes for the SGA tests.  It looks like the new
IRW tests might also need that to prevent session/group name
collisions with the other tests.

Spring and Fall 2022
Very minor changes to match SRI changes.  See Git history
for specifics.

Added code to properly handle the new growth assessment tests.
To pull students for the new growth assessment tests, use
sg for the first part of the administration.  For Fall 2021
for example, the admin parameter would be sgfall21.  If
it sees you were doing an "sg" extract, it pulls all students
in those courses for the year, not just S1/S2.  Otherwise, it
wouldn't get 1st semester students in a year-long class.

Also found a bug in the term code and fixed that.

Added code to properly handle the year-long writing administrations.
Also now converts school #8000 to #8888 to match what Pearson
expects for the Out-Of-District school.

Added a "clobber" task to Rakefile that will clear out all
CSV files.  Changed headers.csv to headers.inp so it won't
get deleted when you run the clobber task.

Due to the odd schedule for 2020-2021, I had to add some
important changes to both the Rakefile and ps2sol.  In
our case, we have some students in-person and some students
fully virtual.  We track that in PowerSchool using the Track
field in the Students table.  For us, A means A-Day
(Monday, Tuesday), B means B-Day (Thursday, Friday),
C means fully in-person, and D means fully virtual.

If you pass the parameter --track to ps2sol, you need
to include a p (in-person) or v (virtual) as well.

Example, pull only virtual students from school 40, the
command might look like this:

  ./ps2sol --school 40 --in 40.csv --type course --admin nwsprg21 --track v
  
In the Rakefile, a line was added for TRACK in case
you want to run all schools for virtual or all for
in-person.  To run all in-person, set that line like:

  TRACK = '--track p'
  
To run all virtual:

  TRACK = '--track v'
  
To run all students:

  TRACK = ''
